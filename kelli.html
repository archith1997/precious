				<h3>Passionate About</h3>
				<ul>
				<p>I love kids, I love the game, I love competition, and I love winning.
                     The greatest joy is helping young people learn the value of commitment,
                      hard work, teamwork, and accountability in the development of their character 
                      - pushing them to excel without compromising doing what is right. </br></br>
                      Seeing kids work hard to achieve individual and team goals while 
                      working through adversity on and off the field is very rewarding.
                       I take the responsibility and privilege of coaching young ladies 
                       very seriously and understand the impact I have on them. </br></br>I enjoy
                        building relationships with my girls that continue after they 
                        leave Baylor. Nothing is more exciting than watching them become 
                        successful in their careers, as wives, and as mothers.</p>
